                        <li>For travel, The Wise Travel Money Card is by far the best card you can ever use. ALL banks hide massive 3-3.5% fees for all travel money cards in their crappy exchange rate. The wise card has a clear ~0.5% fee. It also has a low 1.75% fee (less for first per month) for cash withdraws. In total you save around 2.5-3% in fees when taping to pay, and a bank card in its best circumstances will still be outperformed by the wise card in its worst circumstances when taking cash out overseas.</li>
                        <li>LeechBlock is a great extension for time management, you can block specific websites, set time limits or delays, set filters to disincentivise using it</li>
                        <li>This isnt a product, but set your phone to grayscale. You can do this in the accessibility settings, just google it. This will instantly remove any joy from reals. and is by far the single best way to eliminate reals from your life. The only difficulty will be the urge to re-enable colour</li>
                        <li>For note taking at Uni, I have found getting a tablet with an "s pen" is amazing. Although it feels unnatural not to use paper, it allows you to manage your notes on a level that just isnt possible on paper</li>
